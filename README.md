## My process

- Create HTML structure
- Get fonts
- Add CSS variables
- Put .content class max-width to ~350px
- Put image
- Style the image
- Put texts
- style the texts
- add shadow to .content

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (tho i don't know if it does)

### What I learned

- Setting margin, padding, size etc. with `em` unit which is pretty convenient.
- Setting max-width controls the maximum size of an element. Good for designing for various screen size.

I (extremely) rarely use pure css. Most of the time I use CSS framework/library.
Tried to google as minimum as possible.
